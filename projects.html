    <h2>Educational Reform</h2>
    <p>In my Speech Course, we have to talk about a variety of topics. I have taken this oppurtunity to research educational reform and continue to develop my philosophy of teaching and curriculum. For my upcoming Persuasive Speech, I will be discussing a new way how to look at our current elementary, middle and high schools. Instead of just a linear progression for 12 years, I believe each institution is a rite of passage of learning and mastery. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Elementary School is learning how to learn</li>
            <li>Middle School is learning about the self</li>
            <li>High School is learning how to play a role in a community</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Creating a Directory for a Company</h2>
    <p>For the company that my uncle works at (Lumentum LLC), I want to create a contact directory for the employers to use. Working there during the summers, there is a lot of data needed for tax sales, specifically contact information of county treasurers, tax collectors, assessors, etc. To help out, I will create a webpage that functions as a search engine, using MySQL to create a database to store the information. No only that, but employers may also edit information just so they system will be kept to date. </p>
    <h2>Editing the HackFSU Webpage</h2>
    <p>Joining HackFSU, I have been giving the task to edit and reconstruct the webpage for FSU's Hackathon registration. Not only does the website need to be polished, but I have to create JSON files, and work with Javascript to make sure the website is functional.</p>
