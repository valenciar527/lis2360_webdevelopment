    <h2><i>Introduction</i></h2>
    <p>My name is Richard Joseph Valencia, but I go by RJ. I am 20-years old, a Florida State University Sophomore working towards aquiring my Bachelors in computers (Information, Comunication, and Technology) with a minor in Psychology. This is my e-portfolio decitcating to exhibit my prowness in many different fields and ideologies. Here I will display some of my many works, updating the page with new articles, ideas, and synopses for projects I have worked on. I will also set up links to videos, art and content I think are worthwhile from many talented and thought-provoking creators.</p>
    <h2><i>History</i></h2>
    <p>I was born in Vero Beach, Florida in 1999. I have lived in the sister town called Sebastian for all of my life, a quiet town on the Eastern coast of Florida. I had a lot influence on what my career could be from my family; my mother and grandfather were psychologists, and my father and uncle were programmers. I took a different route, for in my middle school days, I became heavily involved in the world of music during my middle school years, playing percussion in a concert band. This gave me a great sense of joy and pride, and this would continue into high school.</p>
    <p>Sebastian River High School is when I started to develop my sense of self, individual resonsiblity and intergity. I had always strive to do well in school, but with IB and music, I wanted to excel, so I had to learn how to juggle both to perform well while keeping myself healthy. From that, I had accomplished so much: I became one of the top-perfomring muscicians in the band program, became an assistant section leader, received various band awards for my leadership and musical performaces, and received the Bill Posey Congressional Medal of Merit in 2017. This award was given to a senior who exemplified a role-model student, demonstraing academic responsibility and leadership. </p>
    <p>Finally, I graduated with my IB Diploma and high GPA, as well as being accepted to Florida State University. Though I do not engage in a music major in college, it was because of the discipline of band that I have arrived to where I am now. I continue to strive to be one of the best in ICT and Psychology, learning more about responsibility and striving to make something out of myself in the world.</p>
    <h2><i>Future Prospects</i></h2>
    <p>For my career, I want to become a Web Designer, creating and modifying websites for companies to use. I would also like to be a Quality Assurer, testing and debugging websites to see their weakness in their functionality as well in the code. With my computer expertice, I have given thought to possibly creating educational programs or games as well (possibly as a side-project).</p>
    <p>For my Master's degree, I want to pursue policymaking for Florida school systems. I want to create policies that focuses on individual development, places less focus on standarized tesing, and enforces courses that aid students in understanding how the real world will act and what is expected of them. I will also be focusing on what definitions of what the schools want to produce in their students, such as <q>what is adulthood?</q>, <q>what determines success?</q>. I feel by having solutions to these questions, the focus of schools will be more refined, focusing on what will make students competent for the world; not only socially but intrapersonally. Students will feel confidence how to tackle the world in their own way.</p>

    <h2>Educational Reform</h2>
    <p>In my Speech Course, we have to talk about a variety of topics. I have taken this oppurtunity to research educational reform and continue to develop my philosophy of teaching and curriculum. For my upcoming Persuasive Speech, I will be discussing a new way how to look at our current elementary, middle and high schools. Instead of just a linear progression for 12 years, I believe each institution is a rite of passage of learning and mastery. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Elementary School is learning how to learn</li>
            <li>Middle School is learning about the self</li>
            <li>High School is learning how to play a role in a community</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Creating a Directory for a Company</h2>
    <p>For the company that my uncle works at (Lumentum LLC), I want to create a contact directory for the employers to use. Working there during the summers, there is a lot of data needed for tax sales, specifically contact information of county treasurers, tax collectors, assessors, etc. To help out, I will create a webpage that functions as a search engine, using MySQL to create a database to store the information. No only that, but employers may also edit information just so they system will be kept to date. </p>
    <h2>Editing the HackFSU Webpage</h2>
    <p>Joining HackFSU, I have been giving the task to edit and reconstruct the webpage for FSU's Hackathon registration. Not only does the website need to be polished, but I have to create JSON files, and work with Javascript to make sure the website is functional.</p>

        <p>This is a Custom Pattern, incorperating different shades of blues, as well as grey and black. I used the th shades of blue to create a grandient effect for the website's background. I chose these colors because they reflect my high school's colors. I have a deep repspect for that school, for that is where I believe I came into the person I am today. Also, these colors are more relaxing and calm, and remind the user of the water like from the beach. I believe these colors help represent the my character well.</p>
